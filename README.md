# eznfc-android
eznfc-android is a simple library that needs a minimum effort to code out nfc specific operations (nfc write, read, beam)

## Contents
For now this library was tested for beaming and reading tags with text/plain type contents. This library will be further developed to be able to write to tags (Mifare Ultralight/Classic/Desfire etc.) and to use different mime types.
